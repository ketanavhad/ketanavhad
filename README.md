Ketan 👨‍💻 - Application Developer at Hoare Lea 🏢
Hey there! 👋 My name is Ketan and I'm part of the Development team at Hoare Lea, a leading engineering consultancy based in the beautiful city of London 🇬🇧. My focus is on developing tools for sustainability and building physics 🌿🏗️.

About Me 👨‍🎓
I'm a tech enthusiast with a passion for making buildings more sustainable and energy-efficient 🌍. I have experience working with Grasshopper and Rhino, which are powerful 3D modeling tools often used by architects and engineers. I'm also proficient in Python 🐍, a popular programming language used in a variety of fields, including data analysis, web development, and automation.

My Projects 💻
I'm a problem solver at heart and love taking on complex challenges that make a real impact. Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

🌞 Automated Pathfinder: I developed this tool to help suggest the best locations for shading devices in hot cities ☀️. The tool takes into account factors such as building orientation, local climate data, and energy performance to achieve both carbon and cost-effective designs. It's a game-changer for reducing energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions in urban areas 🌆.
🌳 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Calculator: This tool estimates the carbon footprint of a building based on the German OkoBaudat database 🏭. It provides architects and engineers with a detailed breakdown of a building's carbon emissions, allowing them to identify areas where improvements can be made to reduce the building's carbon footprint 🌿.
🚀 Tools for Automating Tedious Projects in IES: I created a suite of Python scripts that automate repetitive tasks in the IES software suite 📊, a powerful tool used for building energy analysis and simulation. These tools have significantly reduced the time required to complete certain tasks and generate reports 📑, enabling more efficient and accurate analysis of building energy performance 🏗️.
Get in Touch 🤝
I'm always up for a chat and love to connect with others who share my passion for sustainability and technology. If you're interested in collaborating on a project or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out via email or LinkedIn (linked in my profile) 📧💼.
